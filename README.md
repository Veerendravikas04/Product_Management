# 🛒 Product Management Application

A full-stack **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application for managing products.  
This project demonstrates strong skills in **frontend development, backend APIs, database integration, and full-stack architecture.**

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Product Management Application is a simple yet powerful web app that allows users to:
